  abstract="We propose a real-time system to detect and track multiple humans from high bird's-eye views. First, we present a fast pipeline to detect humans observed from large distances by efficiently fusing information from a visual and infrared spectrum camera. The main contribution of our work is a new tracking approach. Its novelty lies in online learning of an objectness model which is used for updating a Kalman filter. We show that an adaptive objectness model outperforms a fixed model. Our system achieves a mean tracking loop time of 0.8 ms per human on a 2 GHz CPU which makes real time tracking of multiple humans possible.",
