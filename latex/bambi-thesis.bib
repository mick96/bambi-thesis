  abstract="We propose a real-time system to detect and track multiple humans from high bird's-eye views. First, we present a fast pipeline to detect humans observed from large distances by efficiently fusing information from a visual and infrared spectrum camera. The main contribution of our work is a new tracking approach. Its novelty lies in online learning of an objectness model which is used for updating a Kalman filter. We show that an adaptive objectness model outperforms a fixed model. Our system achieves a mean tracking loop time of 0.8 ms per human on a 2 GHz CPU which makes real time tracking of multiple humans possible.",

abstract = {Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) – also called unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones – are an emerging tool that may provide a safer, more cost-effective, and quieter alternative to traditional research methods. We review examples where UAS have been used to document wildlife abundance, behavior, and habitat, and illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of this technology with two case studies. We summarize research on behavioral responses of wildlife to UAS, and discuss the need to understand how recreational and commercial applications of this technology could disturb certain species. Currently, the widespread implementation of UAS by scientists is limited by flight range, regulatory frameworks, and a lack of validation. UAS are most effective when used to examine smaller areas close to their launch sites, whereas manned aircraft are recommended for surveying greater distances. The growing demand for UAS in research and industry is driving rapid regulatory and technological progress, which in turn will make them more accessible and effective as analytical tools.}
