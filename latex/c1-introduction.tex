In this introduction it is first briefly described the motivation, objective and scope of the project this thesis has been developed in. Once the background has been well set and explained,it will be describe the specific subject of the thesis.


\section{Motivation} % (fold)
\label{sec:motivation}
 Deers gives birth to their offspring during April and May \cite{MowlingMortality}, often choosing meadows as they consider it a safe spot. This period is unfortunately the same in which meadows are cut. The results is that every year a great number of young deers fall victim of combine harvesters cutting hay. Germany counts about 100000 death every harvest season \cite{MowlingMortality}.
 The BambiSaver project was born aiming to provide an autonomous, fast and user friendly device able to search and locate, living creatures in agricultural areas. It is, as a matter of fact, difficult to locate small animals hidden in vast grasslands especially if they freeze when they feel under threat. For this specific reason the proposal design is based on a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) \cite{ICAO} and more precisely a quad-copter equipped with a thermal camera.
 An aerial vehicle is, in fact, able to efficiently cover large surfaces way faster then any other ground alternatives and guarantees the best viewpoint for the specific kind of wildlife research. Moreover it has been chosen a copter rather than a fixed wing model for its holonomic properties which turns out to be very useful in upland regions as well as for small and irregular fields. It is basically why in search and rescue operations helicopters are often adopted instead of planes.

\subsection{Importance for Wildlife and for Agricultural}
\index{Agriculture}
In early hunting literature from as far back as the mid-19th century, references can be found to significant losses of breeding partridges and pheasants from the use of sickle and scythe. Due to the fierce competition in the agricultural sector, developments in agricultural technology have brought about a tremendous acceleration in mowing techniques, with tendency still rising. Today, mowing speed can even exceed 15 km/h, while at the same time ever-wider mowers are used. Nesting birds, young hares and fawns are regular victims of such mowers and even full-grown wild animals cannot always escape. Ever since the 1950s, the importance of silage meadows has increasingly taken precedence over the traditional hay harvest.

\subsection{Affected Species} % (fold)
\label{sub:affected_species}
Grassland is used by countless species of wildlife as food, cover and reproduction habitat. Apart from leverets, fawns and various field birds, small mammals, amphibians and insects all fall victim to the practice of early and more frequent mowing. Formerly reliable survival strategies proven successful over thousands of years have a devastating effect in mowing situations. The instinct of the brooding partridge hen to sit tight on her nest, or of the hare or fawn to freeze motionless, now prove fatal. The optimized patterns of predator avoidance behavior which wild animals have evolved can no longer keep up with the developments in modern cultivation techniques.

\subsection{Measure to Reduce Wildlife Losses} % (fold)
\label{sub:measure_to_reduce_wildlife_losses}
 The most important factor influencing wildlife mortality is without doubt the time of mowing. On the other hand, economic considerations make this a crucial factor for the farmer, too. A late mowing is good for wildlife but not ideal for the farmer from the point of view of yield and quality. Yet there are some other factors in the mowing of arable land which offer potential for reducing wildlife losses \cite{MowlingMortality}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Cutting height}: the higher the cut, the lower will be the losses suffered by crouching animals and nesting birds.
	\item \textit{Mowing direction}: mowing the field from the center outwards gives fully-grown wild animals the opportunity to escape.
	\item \textit{Mowing date}: late cuts,from mid-July onwards, reduce the losses to wildlife during the nesting and rearing period.
	\item \textit{Mowing strategy}: mowing of partial areas, leaving edge strips unmown.
	\item \textit{Mowing frequency}: a longer interval between first and second cuttings reduces the mortality rate, especially for ground-nesting birds.
	\item \textit{Mowing technology}: cutter-bar mowers cause less harm to wild animals than rotary mowers.
\end{itemize}
 Another practical approach is the one adopted in a German wildlife rescue project which consists in deploying small aerial drones to find young deer hiding in tall grass.

\section{State of the art} % (fold)
\label{sec:state_of_the_art}
 During last years, the increasing interest and development of UAS (Unmanned Aircraft System) makes them affordable and suitable for many different applications. Specifically, in wildlife research, drones are frequently use as they are less expensive, quieter, and safer than traditional manned aircraft. Most studies we reviewed recorded minimal or no visible behavioral responses to UAS; however, UAS are capable of causing behavioral and physiological responses in wildlife when observing at close range. \cite{doi:10.1002/fee.1281}.\\
 For the case under-study, the "Flying Wildlife Finder", represents the state-of-the-art.
 The project, developed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR), is an application system which prevents accidents by detecting animals hidden in tall grass during the hay harvest. 
 The "Flying Wildlife Finder", a remotely controlled aerial drone equipped with sensors and a GPS link, is sent on a reconnaissance flight before mowing starts. A high resolution thermal imaging camera detects the temperature of animals hidden in the grass, which is higher than the ambient temperature of the field. Once the animal is located a search party is led to the fawnâ€™s resting place with the help of GPS.
 This solution proves to be good as it is less time-consuming then using trained dog, while maintaining even higher "hit-rate", but it has the main drawback of requiring at least two specialists: one pilot and one camera operator that must be focused on the thermal video stream during the whole mission duration.

 \subsection{Project Goals} % (fold)
 \label{sec:bambisaver_goals}
 The scope of BambiSaver is to design an integrated system capable to autonomously handle every steps of the mission so that it can be operated also by untrained personals. This must be guaranteed even in adverse environments, especially in uneven fields as it is in upland regions. \todo{????the idea was developed having the mountain of Trentino Altoadige in mind????}
 Along with this, it is of particular interest to keep modularity in every hardware and software components. This is to permit easier implementation of new features or improvements.
 All this guidelines \todo{sinonimo per dire idee alla bass} have been taken into account during the design and implementation stages (i.e. ROS as framework for the on-board computer).

 \subsubsection{Software Design concept} % (fold)
 \label{ssub:software_design}
 The raspberry Pi 3 it is used as on-board computer, it runs ROS and manages the transition between the different mission's phases. The software develops according to the usual ROS philosophy \cite{288}, thus it is composed of five nodes implementing every mission component as an independent module. \autoref{fig:rqtgraph} displays all the nodes and the related topics used to let them communicate.

\end{figure}\\
 In the following chapter the thesis will focus, exclusively on two problems:
 \begin{itemize}
  	\item \textit{Geo-referencing the mission's environment and get the field boundary}. This is of great importance, as it define the mission's range which is fundamental for every successive tasks.
  	\item \textit{Planning the coverage path}.It regards planning the geometric path so that the whole field of interest is covered by the sensor footprint.
  \end{itemize}
